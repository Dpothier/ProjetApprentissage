	 carcomplaint text: I bought the 2015 Dodge Journey for my family, shortly after I purchased the vehicle, I noticed the transmission was slow to pick up speed. Since it was a brand new vehicle, I figured the kinks were just getting worked out. I took the Dodge in for a recall for a different issue, and told them check my transmission. They told me the transmission was a learned" transmission meaning it has to get adjusted to the way it's being drove and could need updating. The dealer checked it and said nothing was wrong. A week later iwas on the freeway and it didn't want to pick up speed like it should. The car acts like it gets stuck in between gears. Everytime I get a recall
	 recall text:  On certain vehicles, long-term exposure to high absolute humidity and temperature, combined with high temperature cycling, could eventually degrade the propellant contained in the passenger frontal airbag. This could cause the airbag to deploy with more force than normal. As a result, if the vehicle were involved in a collision that warrants airbag deployment, fragments could be propelled toward vehicle occupants, and the airbag assembly could be damaged, preventing proper function. These issues could increase the risk of injury. Correction: Dealers will replace the airbag inflator.  Note: Canadian climate results in the propellant degrading slowly. The recall is being conducted as a precaution to address future risk, and is expected to replace airbag inflators before their function would be affected.

	 carcomplaint text: I heard a huge bang behind me and then suddenly my son's crying! I looked behind me and surprisingly found that the seat behind me on which my son and his car seat was sitting flipped over and hit my seat in the back. My son's face was injured and bleeding. And it was very close to his eyes. I was thinking how can that happen! I was just at a speed of 25 mph and the seat can flip over like that. If I was driving on a freeway or high way

	 carcomplaint text: The second row seats are not locking in place. As a result, the seat slides back and forth. If there is a person in the seat, it is a very dangerous situation, as my passengers have hit their legs on the seat in front of them going at a very slow speed. To lock the seat, you must force the bar below the seat downward, which will then allow the seat to work as it should. I notice the problem happening after someone has accessed the third row by using the lever on the side of the second row seat to lean the seat forward and let it slide towards the front. When the seat back of the second row seat is returned to its upright position, the seat doesn't lock in place, resulting in it sliding back and forth as the car moves.

	 carcomplaint text: I bought this van with 13 miles on it. The van shakes/shudders on an incline. This occurs from time to time in drive but is very bad when in reverse. I noticed this first when going up a hill to get out of our neighborhood. I first noticed it in reverse when backing out of my driveway which is a very slight incline. The shuddering occurs each time I go up the hill, near our home. Unless the ground is completely flat or I am backing down an incline, reverse feels like an old stick shift that trembles" as you back up or accelerate. I did not buy "new" to have issues like this. The van has less than 30 miles on it."

	 carcomplaint text: The car I am writing about is a Chrysler 300C. That car is not an option in the selection. My 300C is equipped with front and side air bags. When the car was hit on the passenger side by a GMC jimmy the front bags deployed but the side ones did not. Shouldn't the side bags have opened as well? that is my concern.

	 carcomplaint text: I'm submitting this now in response to an event that happened several years ago, triggered by a Dec. 27 2017 recall notice. My vehicle is not listed as affected but I believe it should be because the same problem happened to me about 3 years ago. On that day, a second row outboard seat tipped forward and banged against the back of the driver's seat during a sudden deceleration (we were going down a small hill toward a stoplight, where a vehicle appeared in cross-traffic and unexpectedly blew through its red light, requiring a sudden stop by our vehicle). My then-3-year-old was seated in his forward facing car seat, a britax marathon connected using the latch anchor system, and the entire vehicle seat/car seat combination flipped forward. He was shaken and slightly bruised but otherwise fine, I believe as a result of the protection from the side wings of the car seat. At the time the second row seats had not recently been moved. About two weeks prior they had been removed for hauling a large piece of furniture. Afterward I reinstalled the vehicle seats and believed them to be fully and firmly affixed to the vehicle. I was emotionally disturbed by not only the tipping event itself, but by the knowledge that the seat had been dangerously unattached during those two weeks. I intended to submit a report but then doubted myself. However, the confirmation from the recent recall notice that this is an issue for some Honda Odyssey vehicles (and the knowledge that there is a repair available) immediately made me want to submit this report.

	 carcomplaint text: Currently there is a recall out for the shift lock solenoid assembly in certain Toyota Sienna van models from 2004-2005 and 2007 to 2009. I own a 2005 Sienna le and have no problem with my shift lock solenoid. However, I have a 2006 Sienna le and upon shutting off the car after driving, I can move the automatic transmission selector out of park when the key is out of the ignition and the brake pedal is not depressed. This condition can happen 50 percent of the time and is quite reproducible on my van. I will be contacting Toyota usa today, but I thought it pertinent that your Agency is aware of the problem as well. I have 3 small children, 2 of whom could easily take the car out of gear from a parked position. Thank you.

	 carcomplaint text: I received a letter from Toyota 2 weeks ago indicating the safety recall with the front passenger air bag inflators which were incorrectly manufactured and have the potential to fatally injure the passenger in the event they are deployed in an accident. To date, huntington Toyota of long island has not received the necessary parts to complete the repair for the recall and they have no idea when they will have the parts. I purchased an SUV because I obviously had a need for more seats and room. I use my truck daily transporting my children and their friends to various functions, otherwise I would have gotten a smaller vehicle. So Toyota's suggestion to vehicle owners to not use the passenger seat, is unacceptable. I am requesting that the necessary parts for this airbag be immediately sent to huntington Toyota for my vehicle. I have 3 Toyota vehicles and have been a long time customer, but if this matter is not rectified to my satisfaction, I will no longer consider Toyota vehicles for future purchase.

	 carcomplaint text: We received a recall in June 2014 for the front passenger airbag on our 2002 Toyota Sequoia that was announced in April of 2013 by Toyota as being defective(causing serious harm if deflated as metal parts could strike occupants of vehicle). It is now April of 2015 and we have not been notified by Toyota to have this remedied. According to the status on www.Toyota.com/recall their isn't a remedy available. 2 years have passed and this is too long to have a customer wait for a remedy and it is very disappointing to me as I thought highly of Toyota until now and will spread the word to everyone I know if this isn't taken care of soon. We are tired of not being able to have anyone ride in the front passenger seat. Please get on Toyota to do the right thing and fix our vehicle's front passenger airbag.
	 recall text:  On certain vehicles, long-term exposure to high absolute humidity and temperature, combined with high temperature cycling, could eventually degrade the propellant contained in the passenger frontal airbag. This could cause the airbag to deploy with more force than normal. As a result, if the vehicle were involved in a collision that warrants airbag deployment, fragments could be propelled toward vehicle occupants, and the airbag assembly could be damaged, preventing proper function. These issues could increase the risk of injury. Correction: Dealers will replace the airbag inflator.  Note: Canadian climate results in the propellant degrading slowly.

	 carcomplaint text: Inflator recall - we received a recall letter from Acura in July 2016 that told us to fix the airbag inflator immediately. They also recommended we don't drive our car until the changes have been made. So, we immediately called the dealer and they told us they did not have the part, but would call us when it arrived. A month went by, so we called again and they still did not have the part. After 2 months, we are concerned about the safety of our vehicle due to the long delay in dealership availability. What is the policy on a delay of a dealer's availability to fix a recalled part?

	 carcomplaint text: The contact owns a 2005 Chrysler 300C. The contact's vehicle was involved in a rear end accident on July 22, 2005 while driving at 35 mph. Upon impact, air bags did not deploy. The front end was damaged, lights and radiator were pushed into the engine. The contact was the only occupant in the vehicle, and was wearing seat belts. The air bag warning light was not on prior to this accident. The contact sustained injuries.. the accident was reported to the police and the police did comment about the air bags not deploying. There was property damage in excess of $8000. The car was towed to the dealer because it was not drivable. When he contacted the dealer the following Monday the dealer told the contact that the air bags should have deployed. He contacted Chrysler to launch an investigation. Chrsyler did sent an independent investigator. He received two letters, one stated that they where notified, and the second said that there was not enough damage to the car, and that the conclusion was the computer because it disclosed no codes. This was the second car of this model that he owned. The first car havd problems with the air bag light illuminating, but at the dealership it displayed no codes.

	 carcomplaint text: My car stopped 5 times while driving, two in the middle of a intersection making a left turn and two on the freeway in the thick traffic and one at a stop sign. When I started taking Lemon Law language they gave me a new transmission. They re-flashed the trans module first time, second time replaced module and four time they replaced transmission. I will say, they were good about giving me a rental each time I brought my car in. I do not feel safe in this car. I just got a recall two weeks ago on the transmission and I took it in and they told me they do not have a way to fix it until Chrysler sends them the product to repair the transmission with. So I'm just left to wonder if my car will stall again on the freeway or intersection before they call me to have fixed. GPS has been faulty, they refreshed that. It works ok, I use Waze, its way better than my Chrysler 200 GPS.will be selling this. If this was my wife's car and I had young kids, I would have gotten very ugly about this. Extremely dissatisfied.

This time there is a warning that the airbags could propel fragments toward occupants owing to improperly manufactured propellant charges. There is no warning light nor mitigation procedure offered. Toyota does not state if the vehicle is safe to operate nor do they comment on the stability of the charges or if spontaneous inflation risks have increased. No guidance is forthcoming from Toyota expect wait for further instructions.
